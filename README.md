# Windhawk Dots
### My personal Windows config (meant for use with Windhawk).

## Prerequisites:
You will, of course, need [Windhawk](https://windhawk.net/) to use these. The configs here use the following mods:
- Taskbar Clock Customization
- Windows 11 Start Menu Styler
- Windows 11 Taskbar Styler
- Windows 11 Notification Center Styler
- Windows 11 Lock Screen Styler (some extra work is required to get this working, [here's a tutorial](https://github.com/AromaKitsune/Windows-XAML-Styles/blob/main/guides/Lock-Screen-Styling-Guide.md))

Some fonts are needed if you'd like idendical results, specifically: 

Google Sans Rounded (Private, closed source font. I'd reccomend simply changing the font name in the configs to something else. If you REALLY want it, you can rip the font "Google Sans Flex" from a rooted device running Android 16, and render out a custom font using it with the "rounded" paramters set to max.) 
[SF Pro Fonts](https://github.com/sahibjotsaggu/San-Francisco-Pro-Fonts/tree/master)

These configs are built for my laptop, which has a 1920x1200 display scaled at 125%. **All the configs SHOULD work** (I've tested on other devices), but keep this info in mind if using these on a normal 16:9 display scaled at 100%.
